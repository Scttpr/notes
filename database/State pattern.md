- **Description :** The **state pattern** is a [behavioral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_pattern "Behavioral pattern") [software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern "Software design pattern") that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is close to the concept of [finite-state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine "Finite-state machine"). The state pattern can be interpreted as a [[Strategy pattern]], which is able to switch a strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface.
