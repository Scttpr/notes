- **Description :** The `AS-REProasting` attack is similar to the `Kerberoasting` attack; we can obtain crackable hashes for user accounts that have the property `Do not require Kerberos preauthentication` enabled. The success of this attack depends on the strength of the user account password that we will crack.
