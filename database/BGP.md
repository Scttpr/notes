- **Description :** **Border Gateway Protocol** (**BGP**) is a standardized [exterior gateway protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_gateway_protocol "Exterior gateway protocol") designed to exchange [routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing "Routing") and reachability information among [autonomous systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet) "Autonomous system (Internet)") (AS) on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). BGP is classified as a [path-vector routing protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path-vector_routing_protocol "Path-vector routing protocol"), and it makes [routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing "Routing") decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a [network administrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_administrator "Network administrator").
