- **Description :** The primary goal of dynamic analysis is to document and understand the real-world impact of the malware on its host environment, making it an integral part of comprehensive malware analysis. In executing dynamic analysis, we encapsulate the malware within a tightly controlled, monitored, and usually isolated environment to prevent any unintentional spread or damage. This environment is typically a virtual machine (VM) to which the malware is oblivious. It believes it is interacting with a genuine system, while we, as researchers, have full control over its interactions and can document its behavior thoroughly.

## Process

- `Environment Setup`: We first establish a secure and controlled environment, typically a `VM`, isolated from the rest of the network to prevent inadvertent contamination or propagation of the malware. The VM setup should mimic a real-world system, complete with software, applications, and network configurations that an actual user might have.
- `Baseline Capture`: After the environment is set up, we capture a snapshot of the system's clean state. This includes `system files`, `registry states`, `running processes`, `network configuration`, and more. This baseline serves as a reference point to identify changes made by the malware post-execution.
- `Tool Deployment (Pre-Execution)`: To capture the activities of the malware effectively, we deploy various monitoring and logging tools. Tools such as `Process Monitor (Procmon)` from Sysinternals Suite are used to log system calls, file system activity, registry operations, etc. We can also employ utilities like `Wireshark`, `tcpdump`, and `Fiddler` for capturing network traffic, and `Regshot` to take before-and-after snapshots of the system registry. Finally, tools such as `INetSim`, `FakeDNS`, and `FakeNet-NG` are used to simulate internet services.
- `Malware Execution`: With our tools running and ready, we proceed to execute the malware sample in the isolated environment. During execution, the monitoring tools capture and log all activities, including process creation, file and registry modifications, network traffic, etc.
- `Observation and Logging`: The malware sample is allowed to execute for a sufficient duration. All the while, our monitoring tools are diligently recording its every move, which will provide us with comprehensive insight into its behavior and modus operandi.
- `Analysis of Collected Data`: After the malware has run its course, we halt its execution and stop the monitoring tools. We now examine the logs and data collected, comparing the system's state to our initial baseline to identify the changes introduced by the malware.
