- **Description :** In [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), the **transport layer** is a conceptual division of methods in the [layered architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer "Abstraction layer") of protocols in the network stack in the [Internet protocol suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite "Internet protocol suite") and the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model "OSI model"). The protocols of this layer provide end-to-end communication services for applications. It provides services such as [connection-oriented communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection-oriented_communication "Connection-oriented communication"), [reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(computer_networking) "Reliability (computer networking)"), [flow control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_control_(data) "Flow control (data)"), and [multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing "Multiplexing").
