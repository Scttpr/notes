- **Description :** The **data link layer**, or **layer 2**, is the second layer of the seven-layer [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model "OSI model") of [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"). This layer is the protocol layer that transfers data between nodes on a [network segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_segment "Network segment") across the [physical layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer "Physical layer"). The data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to [transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(computing) "Transfer (computing)") data between network entities and may also provide the means to detect and possibly correct errors that can occur in the physical layer.
