- **Description :** The **File Transfer Protocol** (**FTP**) is a standard [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") used for the transfer of [computer files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file "Computer file") from a server to a client on a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"). FTP is built on a [client–server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model "Client–server model") architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves with a [plain-text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext") sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often [secured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#Security) with [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security "Transport Layer Security") ([FTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTPS "FTPS")) or replaced with [SSH File Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol "SSH File Transfer Protocol") (SFTP).
