- **Description :** a lightweight and portable command-line YAML, JSON and XML processor. `yq` uses [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) like syntax but works with yaml files as well as json, xml, properties, csv and tsv. It doesn't yet support everything `jq` does - but it does support the most common operations and functions, and more is being added continuously.
