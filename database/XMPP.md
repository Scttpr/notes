- **Description :** **Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol** (**XMPP**, originally named **Jabber**) is an [open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard "Open standard") [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") designed for [instant messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging "Instant messaging") (IM), [presence information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presence_information "Presence information"), and [contact list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_list "Contact list") maintenance. Based on [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML") (Extensible Markup Language), it enables the [near-real-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-real-time "Near-real-time") exchange of structured data between two or more network entities. Designed to be [extensible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensibility "Extensibility"), the protocol offers a multitude of applications beyond traditional IM in the broader realm of [message-oriented middleware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message-oriented_middleware "Message-oriented middleware"), including signalling for [VoIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP "Voice over IP"), video, [file transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_transfer "File transfer"), [gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game "Game") and other uses.
