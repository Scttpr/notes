- **Description :** CrackMapExec (a.k.a CME) is a post-exploitation tool that helps automate assessing the security of _large_ Active Directory networks. Built with stealth in mind, CME follows the concept of "Living off the Land": abusing built-in Active Directory features/protocols to achieve it's functionality and allowing it to evade most endpoint protection/IDS/IPS solutions.
