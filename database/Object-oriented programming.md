The data is in the form of [fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(computer_science) "Field (computer science)") (often known as [attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute_(computing) "Attribute (computing)") or _[properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(programming) "Property (programming)")_), and the code is in the form of procedures (often known as _[methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_science) "Method (computer science)")_).
