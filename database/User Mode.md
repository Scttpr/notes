- **Description :** This mode is where most applications and user processes operate. Applications in user mode have limited access to system resources and must interact with the operating system through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These processes are isolated from each other and cannot directly access hardware or critical system functions. However, in this mode, malware can still manipulate files, registry settings, network connections, and other user-accessible resources, and it may attempt to escalate privileges to gain more control over the system.

## Components

- `System Support Processes`: These are essential components that provide crucial functionalities and services such as logon processes (`winlogon.exe`), Session Manager (`smss.exe`), and Service Control Manager (`services.exe`). These aren't Windows services but they are necessary for the proper functioning of the system.
- `Service Processes`: These processes host Windows services like the `Windows Update Service`, `Task Scheduler`, and `Print Spooler` services. They usually run in the background, executing tasks according to their configuration and parameters.
- `User Applications`: These are the processes created by user programs, including both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. They interact with the operating system through [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_API) provided by Windows. These API calls get redirected to [NTDLL.DLL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_library_files#NTDLL.DLL), triggering a transition from user mode to kernel mode, where the system call gets executed. The result is then returned to the user-mode application, and a transition back to user mode occurs.
- `Environment Subsystems`: These components are responsible for providing execution environments for specific types of applications or processes. They include the [Win32 Subsystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Windows_NT#Win32_environment_subsystem), [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_POSIX_subsystem), and [OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2).
- `Subsystem DLLs`: These dynamic-link libraries translate documented functions into appropriate internal native system calls, primarily implemented in `NTDLL.DLL`. Examples include `kernelbase.dll`, `user32.dll`, `wininet.dll`, and `advapi32.dll`.
