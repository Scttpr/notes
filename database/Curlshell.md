- **Description :** During security research, you may end up running code in an environment, where establishing raw TCP connections to the outside world is not possible; outgoing connection may only go through a connect proxy (HTTPS_PROXY). This simple interactive HTTP server provides a way to mux stdin/stdout and stderr of a remote reverse shell over that proxy with the help of curl.
