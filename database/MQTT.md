- **Description :** [machine to machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_to_machine "Machine to machine") network [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") for [message queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue "Message queue")/[message queuing service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queuing_service "Message queuing service"). It is designed for connections with remote locations that have devices with resource constraints or limited network [bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing) "Bandwidth (computing)"), such as in the [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things "Internet of Things") (IoT). It must run over a transport protocol that provides ordered, [lossless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression "Lossless compression"), bi-directional connectionsâ€”typically, [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP "TCP/IP"), but also possibly over [QUIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC "QUIC") It is an open [OASIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OASIS_(organization) "OASIS (organization)") standard and an [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization "International Organization for Standardization") recommendation (**ISO/IEC 20922**)
