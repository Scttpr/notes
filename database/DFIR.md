- **Description :** Digital forensics, often referred to as computer forensics or cyber forensics, is a specialized branch of cybersecurity that involves the collection, preservation, analysis, and presentation of digital evidence to investigate cyber incidents, criminal activities, and security breaches. It applies forensic techniques to digital artifacts, including computers, servers, mobile devices, networks, and storage media, to uncover the truth behind cyber-related events. Digital forensics aims to reconstruct timelines, identify malicious activities, assess the impact of incidents, and provide evidence for legal or regulatory proceedings. Digital forensics is an integral part of the incident response process, contributing crucial insights and support at various stages.

## Key concepts

- `Electronic Evidence`: Digital forensics deals with electronic evidence, which can include files, emails, logs, databases, network traffic, and more. This evidence is collected from computers, mobile devices, servers, cloud services, and other digital sources.
- `Preservation of Evidence`: Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of digital evidence is crucial. Proper procedures are followed to preserve evidence, establish a chain of custody, and prevent any unintentional alterations.
- `Forensic Process`: The digital forensics process typically involves several stages:
    - `Identification`: Determining potential sources of evidence.
    - `Collection`: Gathering data using forensically sound methods.
    - `Examination`: Analyzing the collected data for relevant information.
    - `Analysis`: Interpreting the data to draw conclusions about the incident.
    - `Presentation`: Presenting findings in a clear and comprehensible manner.
- `Types of Cases`: Digital forensics is applied in a variety of cases, including:
    - Cybercrime investigations (hacking, fraud, data theft).
    - Intellectual property theft.
    - Employee misconduct investigations.
    - Data breaches and incidents affecting organizations.
    - Litigation support in legal proceedings.

The basic steps for performing a forensic investigation are as follows:

1. `Create a Forensic Image`
2. `Document the System's State`
3. `Identify and Preserve Evidence`
4. `Analyze the Evidence`
5. `Timeline Analysis`
6. `Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)`
7. `Report and Documentation`
