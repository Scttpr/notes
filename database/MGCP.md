- **Description :** The **Media Gateway Control Protocol** (**MGCP**) is a [telecommunication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") for signaling and call control in hybrid [voice over IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP "Voice over IP") (VoIP) and traditional [telecommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication "Telecommunication") systems. It implements the [media gateway control protocol architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_gateway_control_protocol_architecture "Media gateway control protocol architecture") for controlling [media gateways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_gateway "Media gateway") connected to the [public switched telephone network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network "Public switched telephone network") (PSTN). The media gateways provide conversion of traditional electronic media to the [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP) network. The protocol is a successor to the [Simple Gateway Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Gateway_Control_Protocol "Simple Gateway Control Protocol") (SGCP), which was developed by [Bellcore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellcore "Bellcore") and [Cisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco "Cisco"), and the [Internet Protocol Device Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Device_Control "Internet Protocol Device Control") (IPDC)
