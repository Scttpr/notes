- **Description :** **YAML** ([/ˈjæməl/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")) _(see [§ History and name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#History_and_name))_ is a [human-readable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-readable "Human-readable") [data serialization language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_serialization_language "Data serialization language"). It is commonly used for [configuration files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file "Configuration file") and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications applications as [Extensible Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Markup_Language "Extensible Markup Language") (XML) but has a minimal syntax which intentionally differs from [Standard Generalized Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language "Standard Generalized Markup Language") (SGML). It uses both [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) "Python (programming language)")-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact format that uses `[...]` for lists and `{...}` for maps but forbids tab characters to use as indentation thus only some [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON "JSON") files are valid YAML
