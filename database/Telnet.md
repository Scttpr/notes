- **Description :** **Telnet** (short for "teletype network") is a [client/server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model "Client–server model") [application protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer "Application layer") that provides access to virtual [terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal "Computer terminal") of [remote systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_system "Remote system") on [local area networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network") or the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). Telnet consists of two components: (1) the protocol itself which specifies how two parties are to communicate and (2) the software application that provides the service. User data is interspersed [in-band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-band_signaling "In-band signaling") with Telnet control information in an 8-bit [byte oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_oriented "Byte oriented") data connection over the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") (TCP). Telnet was developed in 1969 beginning with [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)") [15](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc15), extended in [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_(identifier) "RFC (identifier)") [855](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc855), and standardized as [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force "Internet Engineering Task Force") (IETF) Internet Standard [STD 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STD_8 "STD 8"), one of the first Internet standards. Telnet transmits all information including usernames and passwords in plaintext so it is not recommended for security-sensitive applications such as [remote management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_monitoring_and_management "Remote monitoring and management") of routers. Telnet's use for this purpose has waned significantly in favor of [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell "Secure Shell"). Some extensions to Telnet which would provide encryption have been proposed
