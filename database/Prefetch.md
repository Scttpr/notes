- **Description :** `Prefetch` is a Windows operating system feature that helps optimize the loading of applications by preloading certain components and data. Prefetch files are created for every program that is executed on a Windows system, and this includes both installed applications and standalone executables. The naming convention of Prefetch files is indeed based on the original name of the executable file, followed by a hexadecimal value of the path where the executable file resides, and it ends with the `.pf` file extension.
