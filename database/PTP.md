- **Description :** The **Precision Time Protocol** (**PTP**) is a [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(computing) "Protocol (computing)") used to [synchronize clocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_synchronization "Clock synchronization") throughout a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"). On a [local area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network"), it achieves clock accuracy in the sub-microsecond range, making it suitable for measurement and control systems. PTP is employed to synchronize [financial transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction "Financial transaction"), [mobile phone tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_tower "Mobile phone tower") transmissions, sub-sea [acoustic arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_array "Acoustic array"), and networks that require precise timing but lack access to [satellite navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation "Satellite navigation") signals.
