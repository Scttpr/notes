- **Description :** Windows operating systems employ the `Portable Executable (PE)` format to encapsulate executable programs, `DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries)`, and other integral system components. In the realm of malware analysis, an intricate understanding of the PE file format is indispensable. It allows us to gain significant insights into the executable's structure, operations, and potential malign activities embedded within the file. PE files accommodate a wide variety of data types including `executables (.exe)`, `dynamic link libraries (.dll)`, `kernel modules (.srv)`, `control panel applications (.cpl)`, and many more. The PE file format is fundamentally a data structure containing the vital information required for the Windows OS loader to manage the executable code, effectively loading it into memory.

## Sections

- `Text Section (.text)`: The hub where the executable code of the program resides.
- `Data Section (.data)`: A storage for initialized global and static data variables.
- `Read-only initialized data (.rdata)`: Houses read-only data such as constant values, string literals, and initialized global and static variables.
- `Exception information (.pdata)`: A collection of function table entries utilized for exception handling.
- `BSS Section (.bss)`: Holds uninitialized global and static data variables.
- `Resource Section (.rsrc)`: Safeguards resources such as images, icons, strings, and version information.
- `Import Section (.idata)`: Details about functions imported from other DLLs.
- `Export Section (.edata)`: Information about functions exported by the executable.
- `Relocation Section (.reloc)`: Details for relocating the executable's code and data when loaded at a different memory address.

## Notes

- On a Windows system, the presence of the ASCII string `MZ` (in hexadecimal: `4D 5A`) at the start of a file (known as the "magic number") denotes an executable file. `MZ` stands for Mark Zbikowski, a key architect of MS-DOS.
