- **Description :** The **Internet protocol suite**, commonly known as **TCP/IP**, is a framework for organizing the set of [communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") used in the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") and similar [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network") according to functional criteria. The foundational protocols in the suite are the [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") (TCP), the [User Datagram Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol") (UDP), and the [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP). Early versions of this networking model were known as the **Department of Defense** (**DoD**) **model** because the research and development were funded by the [United States Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense "United States Department of Defense") through [DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA "DARPA").
