- **Description :** In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"), the **strategy pattern** (also known as the **policy pattern**) is a [behavioral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_design_pattern "Behavioral design pattern") [software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science) "Design pattern (computer science)") that enables selecting an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") at runtime.
